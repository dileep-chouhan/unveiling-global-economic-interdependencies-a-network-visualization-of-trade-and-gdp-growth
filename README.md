# Unveiling Global Economic Interdependencies: A Network Visualization of Trade and GDP Growth

## Overview

This project visualizes global economic interdependencies by analyzing relationships between nations' trade flows and GDP growth.  The analysis aims to identify key economic relationships and potential vulnerabilities within the global economy. This interactive visualization provides insights into interconnectedness, allowing for more proactive risk assessment for investors and policymakers.  The project leverages network analysis techniques to represent countries as nodes and trade flows/GDP correlations as edges, revealing clusters of highly interconnected economies and identifying potential points of systemic risk.


## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* NetworkX (likely, depending on the chosen network visualization method)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.  Then, install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will process the data and generate the visualization.


## Example Output

The script will produce the following outputs:

* **Console Output:**  Printed summary statistics and key findings from the analysis, such as the most influential countries in the global trade network or significant clusters of interconnected economies.  This might include details about the strength of correlations between GDP growth and trade.
* **Visualization:** An interactive network graph (e.g., using a library like Plotly) will be generated, showing the relationships between countries based on trade flows and GDP growth correlations. This allows users to explore the network, identify key nodes, and analyze the overall structure of the global economic network.  The visualization may be saved as an HTML file (e.g., `global_economic_network.html`) or displayed directly in a browser.


## Data

[Optional: Add a section describing the data source, format, and any preprocessing steps.]  For example:

**Data:** The project utilizes trade flow data from [Data Source Citation] and GDP growth data from [Data Source Citation].  The data is preprocessed to ensure consistency and compatibility with the analysis techniques employed.  Data cleaning and transformation steps are documented within the `data_preprocessing.py` script (if applicable).
